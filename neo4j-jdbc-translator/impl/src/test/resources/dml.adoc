= DML statements

In this section we list the supported Data-Manipulation-Language (DML) statements.
While a `SELECT` statement is technically DML as well, as it is used to project existing relations into new relations, it has been covered previously.

== Deleting nodes

Nodes can be deleted via the SQL `DELETE` statement.
This can happen unconditionally:

[source,sql,id=d0_0,name=delete]
----
DELETE FROM person
----

which will delete all `person` nodes:

[source,cypher,id=d0_0_expected]
----
MATCH (person:person)
DELETE person
----

A `WHERE` clause can be added to prevent this and all conditions can be used:

[source,sql,id=d0_1,name=delete]
----
DELETE FROM person
WHERE person.id = 1
----

so that only the `person` node with a matching property is deleted.

[source,cypher,id=d0_1_expected]
----
MATCH (person:person)
WHERE person.id = 1
DELETE person
----

If you want to delete everything, but your tooling is complaining, just add a conditions that is always `true`:

[source,sql,id=d0_1b,name=delete]
----
DELETE FROM person
WHERE true
----

Your data is gone, either way:

[source,cypher,id=d0_1b_expected]
----
MATCH (person:person)
WHERE true
DELETE person
----

This is safer, but also pointless:

[source,sql,id=d0_1c,name=delete]
----
DELETE FROM person
WHERE false
----

Your data is gone, either way:

[source,cypher,id=d0_1c_expected]
----
MATCH (person:person)
WHERE false
DELETE person
----

Tables can be aliased

[source,sql,id=d0_2,name=delete]
----
DELETE FROM person p
----

and the alias will be used in Cypher, too:

[source,cypher,id=d0_2_expected]
----
MATCH (p:person)
DELETE p
----

Alias tables is also support in combination with specifying the label to which the table name is mapped.
Using the same query with `table_mappings=person:Person` configured,

[source,sql,id=d0_3,name=delete,table_mappings=person:Person]
----
DELETE FROM person p
----

will be translated to

[source,cypher,id=d0_3_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
DELETE p
----

== Deleting nodes and their related nodes

You can use SQL `TRUNCATE` to detach delete nodes.

[source,sql,id=d0_4,name=truncate,table_mappings=people:Person]
----
TRUNCATE TABLE people
----

will be translated to

[source,cypher,id=d0_4_expected]
----
MATCH (people:Person)
DETACH DELETE people
----

== Inserting data

A single list of values with explicit columns and constant values can be inserted with a simple `INSERT` statement:

[source,sql,id=d1_0,name=insert,table_mappings=people:Person]
----
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, born) VALUES ('Helge', 'Schneider', 1955)
----

which will be translated to:

[source,cypher,id=d1_0_expected]
----
CREATE (people:`Person` {first_name: 'Helge', last_name: 'Schneider', born: 1955})
----

All expressions, including parameters, are supported:

[source,sql,id=d1_1,name=insert,table_mappings=people:Person]
----
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, born) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
----

Parameters will be named from 0 on upwards in Cypher:

[source,cypher,id=d1_1_expected]
----
CREATE (people:`Person` {first_name: $1, last_name: $2, born: $3})
----

If you omit the columns names on the insertion target, we generate names:

[source,sql,id=d1_2,name=insert,table_mappings=people:Person]
----
INSERT INTO People VALUES ('Helge', 'Schneider', 1955)
----

Note the `unknown field xxx` graph properties created:

[source,cypher,id=d1_2_expected]
----
CREATE (people:`Person` {`unknown field 0`: 'Helge', `unknown field 1`: 'Schneider', `unknown field 2`: 1955})
----

The SQL `VALUES` clause actually supports list of values:

[source,sql,id=d1_3,name=insert,table_mappings=people:Person]
----
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, born) VALUES
    ('Helge', 'Schneider', 1955),
    ('Bela', 'B', 1962)
----

Those values will be translated into a Cypher array to be unwind in the Cypher statement.
This is a great solution for batching inserts:

[source,cypher,id=d1_3_expected]
----
UNWIND [
  {first_name: 'Helge', last_name: 'Schneider', born: 1955},
  {first_name: 'Bela', last_name: 'B', born: 1962}]
AS properties
CREATE (people:`Person`)
SET people = properties
----

A returning clause is supported as well, so that

[source,sql,id=d1_4,name=insert,table_mappings=people:Person]
----
INSERT INTO People p (name) VALUES (?) RETURNING elementId(p)
----

is translated into

[source,cypher,id=d1_4_expected]
----
CREATE (p:Person {name: $1}) RETURN elementId(p)
----

== Upserts

We support a restricted range of "upserts" via the non-standard but pretty common `ON DUPLICATE` and `ON CONFLICT` SQL clauses.
Upserts will generally be translated to `MERGE` statements.
While they tend to work without constraints, you really should but unique-constraints on the node properties you merge on.
Otherwise, Neo4j create duplicates due to locking issues.
Read me more about the latter https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/understanding-how-merge-works/[here].

Two options are possible to merge on all columns inserted via `ON DUPLICATE KEY IGNORE` and `ON CONFLICT IGNORE`.

[source,sql,id=upsert1]
----
INSERT INTO Movie(title, released) VALUES(?, ?) ON DUPLICATE KEY IGNORE
----

will be translated to:

[source,cypher,id=upsert1_expected]
----
MERGE (movie:`Movie` {title: $1, released: $2})
----

The same goes for `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
In the example we configured a table mapping:

[source,sql,id=upsert2,table_mappings=actors:Actor]
----
INSERT INTO actors(name, firstname) VALUES(?, ?) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
----

will be translated to:

[source,cypher,id=upsert2_expected]
----
MERGE (actors:`Actor` {name: $1, firstname: $2})
----

If you want to define an action, you must use `ON CONFLICT` specifying the key you want to merge on.
While `ON DUPLICATE KEY` does offer upgrade options, it assumes the primary (or unique) key being violated to be known.
This is most certainly the case in a relational system, but not in this translation layer, that does run without a database connection:

[source,sql,id=upsert3]
----
INSERT INTO tbl(i, j, k) VALUES (1, 40, 700)
ON CONFLICT (i) DO UPDATE SET j = 0, k = 2 * EXCLUDED.k
----

Take note how the special reference `EXCLUDED` can be used to refer to the values of columns that have not been part of the key.
They will be reused with their values in the `ON MATCH SET` clause.

[source,cypher,id=upsert3_expected]
----
MERGE (tbl:`tbl` {i: 1})
ON CREATE SET tbl.j = 40, tbl.k = 700
ON MATCH SET tbl.j = 0, tbl.k = (2 * 700)
----

This works with parameters, too:

[source,sql,id=upsert4]
----
INSERT INTO tbl(i, j, k) VALUES (1, 2, ?)
ON CONFLICT (i) DO UPDATE SET j = EXCLUDED.k
----

Same result, but referring to the parameter:

[source,cypher,id=upsert4_expected]
----
MERGE (tbl:`tbl` {i: 1})
ON CREATE SET tbl.j = 2, tbl.k = $1
ON MATCH SET tbl.j = $1
----

If you just want to specify a concrete merge column instead of merging on all columns, this possible too:

[source,sql,id=upsert3b]
----
INSERT INTO tbl(i, j, k) VALUES (1, 40, 700)
ON CONFLICT (i) DO NOTHING
----

will be using `ON CREATE` only:

[source,cypher,id=upsert3b_expected]
----
MERGE (tbl:`tbl` {i: 1})
ON CREATE SET tbl.j = 40, tbl.k = 700
----


Using `ON CONFLICT` and specifying a key is the only way to insert multiple rows with a `MERGE` statement:

[source,sql,id=upsert5]
----
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, born) VALUES
    ('Helge', 'Schneider', 1955),
    ('Bela', 'B', 1962)
ON CONFLICT(last_name) DO UPDATE SET born = EXCLUDED.born
----

[source,cypher,id=upsert5_expected]
----
UNWIND [{first_name: 'Helge', last_name: 'Schneider', born: 1955}, {first_name: 'Bela', last_name: 'B', born: 1962}] AS properties
MERGE (people:`People` {last_name: properties['last_name']})
ON CREATE SET
  people.first_name = properties.first_name,
  people.born = properties.born
ON MATCH SET people.born = properties['born']
----
