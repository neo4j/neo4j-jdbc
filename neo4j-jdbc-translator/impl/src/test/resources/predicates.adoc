= Predicates
:toc:

As with expressions a lot of logical SQL expressions and conditions used as predicates can be translated straightforward into Cypher predicates.

== Conjunctions and disjunctions

Logical conjunctions and disjunctions are all supported.

[source,sql,id=p1_0,name=logic_operators]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 1 = 1 AND 2 = 2 OR 3 = 3
----

[source,cypher,id=p1_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE ((1 = 1
    AND 2 = 2)
  OR 3 = 3)
RETURN 1
----

'''

The input

[source,sql,id=p1_1,name=logic_operators_rare]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE NOT 1 = 1 XOR 2 = 2
----

will be translated to

[source,cypher,id=p1_1_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE (NOT (1 = 1)
  XOR 2 = 2)
RETURN 1
----

== Operators

=== Arithmetic operators

The input

[source,sql,id=p2_0,name=predicates_with_arithmetics]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 1 = 1 AND 2 > 1 AND 1 < 2 AND 1 <= 2 AND 2 >= 1 AND 1 != 2
----

will be translated to

[source,cypher,id=p2_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE (1 = 1
  AND 2 > 1
  AND 1 < 2
  AND 1 <= 2
  AND 2 >= 1
  AND 1 <> 2)
RETURN 1
----

=== Between

Between in SQL is inclusive

[source,sql,id=p2_1,name=predicate_between]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 2 BETWEEN 1 AND 3
----

and will be translated to (we can't generate the shorter form (`1 <= 2 <= 3`) due to restrictions in the underlying generator):

[source,cypher,id=p2_1_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE (1 <= 2) AND (2 <= 3)
RETURN 1
----

'''

SQL has a `SYMMETRIC` keyword for the `BETWEEN` clause, to indicate that you do not care which bound of the range is larger:

[source,sql,id=p2_2,name=predicate_between_symmetric]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 2 BETWEEN SYMMETRIC 3 AND 1
----

We translate this into a disjunction:

[source,cypher,id=p2_2_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE (3 <= 2) AND (2 <= 1) OR (1 <= 2) AND (2 <= 3)
RETURN 1
----

== Logical row value expressions

The above examples are based on scalar expressions.
Row value expressions will be translated as well:

[source,sql,id=p1_2,name=logic_operators]
----
SELECT 1
FROM p
WHERE (1, 2) = (3, 4)
OR (1, 2) < (3, 4)
OR (1, 2) <= (3, 4)
OR (1, 2, 3) <> (4, 5, 6)
OR (1, 2, 3) > (4, 5, 6)
OR (1, 2, 3) >= (4, 5, 6)
----

Leads to a semantically equivalent cypher:

[source,cypher,id=p1_2_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE 1 = 3 AND 2 = 4
OR (1 < 3 OR 1 = 3 AND 2 < 4)
OR (1 < 3 OR 1 = 3 AND 2 <= 4)
OR (1 != 4 AND 2 != 5 AND 3 != 6)
OR (1 > 4 OR 1 = 4 AND (2 > 5 OR 2 = 5 AND 3 > 6))
OR (1 > 4 OR 1 = 4 AND (2 > 5 OR 2 = 5 AND 3 >= 6))
RETURN 1
----

== Null Handling

=== For scalar expressions

The input

[source,sql,id=p3_0,name=predicates_nullability]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 1 IS NULL AND 2 IS NOT NULL
----

will be translated to

[source,cypher,id=p3_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE (1 IS NULL
  AND 2 IS NOT NULL)
RETURN 1
----

=== For row value expressions

The input

[source,sql,id=p4_0,name=predicates_row_is_null]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE (1, 2) IS NULL OR (3, 4) IS NOT NULL
----

will be translated to

[source,cypher,id=p4_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:p)
WHERE
  (1 IS NULL AND 2 IS NULL)
  OR (3 IS NOT NULL AND 4 IS NOT NULL)
RETURN 1
----

== `LIKE` operator

The `LIKE` operator

[source,sql,id=p5_0,name=predicates_like]
----
SELECT * FROM movies m WHERE m.title LIKE '%Matrix%'
----

will be translated into a regular expressions, replacing the `%` with `.*`:

[source,cypher,id=p5_0_expected]
----
MATCH (m:`movies`) WHERE m.title =~ '.*Matrix.*'
RETURN *
----
