= Translation concepts

== Table names to labels

The most simple select statement to translate is a statement without the `FROM` clause, such as:

[source,sql,id=t1_1,name=no_driving_table]
----
SELECT 1
----

It is equivalent without loss to the following Cypher:

[source,cypher,id=t1_1_expected]
----
RETURN 1
----

`SELECT` statements without further `JOIN` clauses are pretty straight forward to translate.
The hardest challenge here is how to map the table name to labels:

* We parse the SQL Statement case-sensitive by default
* Table names will be mapped to node labels
* Table aliases will be used as identifiable symbolic names

[source,sql,id=t1_0,name=select_with_condition]
----
SELECT t.a, t.b
FROM My_Table -- <.>
  AS t -- <.>
WHERE t.a = 1
----
<.> Will be used as the label to match, as-is, i.e. `My_Table`
<.> The table alias will become the node-alias

The whole construct will be translated to

[source,cypher,id=t1_0_expected]
----
MATCH (t:My_Table)
WHERE t.a = 1
RETURN t.a, t.b
----

We recommend using table aliases, but the translations works without them as well.

[#s2c_star_selects]
== Star-Selects

A star- or `*` select comes in different forms:

Unqualified::
`SELECT * FROM table`
Qualified::
`SELECT t.* FROM table t`

And a variant, selecting the relation itself: `SELECT t FROM table t`.

We make use of this fact to give users a way to decide whether they want to return Neo4j nodes and relationships as entities, maps or flattened to individual columns.
The latter however requires our translator to have access to the schema of the underlying Neo4j database.
The following sections will describe the use-cases:

=== Projecting individual properties

Don't use a star-select but enumerate the properties:

[source,sql,id=star_1]
----
SELECT m.title FROM Movie m
----

The table alias will be used as a symbolic name

[source,cypher,id=star_1_expected]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m.title;
----

You can omit the table alias:

[source,sql,id=star_2]
----
SELECT title FROM Movie
----

The lower-cased table name will be the symbolic name:

[source,cypher,id=star_2_expected]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title;
----

If you access your JDBC columns by name, this might lead to code that is hard to maintain
You might want to alias the column, then:

[source,sql,id=star_3]
----
SELECT title AS title FROM Movie
----

So that it has a stable, well-known name:

[source,cypher,id=star_3_expected]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title AS title;
----

=== Projecting all properties

If you run a

[source,sql,id=star_5]
----
SELECT * FROM Movie m
----

you will get the following Cypher statement in case you run the translation offline:

[source,cypher,id=star_5_expected]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN *
----

The above query will return one column ("m"), which is a Neo4j node.
This is usually not what is expected in the relational world.
If you run the translation online and Neo4j metadata can be retrieved,
it will generate a statement that flattens the properties of each node and relationship plus their element ids:

In case the `Person` node has properties `born` and `name`

[source,sql,id=star_6,name=unqualifiedAsteriskSingleTable,metaData=Person:born|name]
----
SELECT * FROM Person p
----

you will get this Cypher statement

[source,cypher,id=star_6_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN elementId(p) AS element_id,
       p.born AS born, p.name AS name
----

This works well with multiple tables as well (`Movie` has properties `title` and `released`)

[source,sql,id=star_7,name=unqualifiedAsteriskMultipleTables,metaData=Person:born|name;Movie:title|released]
----
SELECT * FROM Person p JOIN Movie m ON m.id = p.acted_in
----

Properties will be delivered as requested:

[source,cypher,id=star_7_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[acted_in:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN elementId(p) AS element_id, p.born AS born, p.name AS name,
       elementId(m) AS element_id1, m.title AS title, m.released AS released
----

We add increasing numbers to column names if they clash (we duplicated the `name` property and added a `remark` to the metadata):

[source,sql,id=star_8,name=unqualifiedAsteriskDuplicatedColumns,metaData=Person:born|name|remark;Movie:name|released|remark]
----
SELECT * FROM Person p JOIN Movie m ON m.id = p.acted_in
----

Note the increasing numbers per duplicate name:

[source,cypher,id=star_8_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[acted_in:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN elementId(p) AS element_id,
       p.born AS born, p.name AS name, p.remark AS remark,
       elementId(m) AS element_id1,
       m.name AS name1, m.released AS released, m.remark AS remark1
----

The following example uses a join-table to access relationships (we explain this later in this manual), but the flattening of properties works there as well:

[source,sql,id=star_9,name=unqualifiedAsteriskJoinTable, metaData=ACTED_IN:role;Person:born|name;Movie:title|released,table_mappings=people:Person;movies:Movie;movie_actors:ACTED_IN]
----
SELECT *
FROM people p
JOIN movie_actors r ON r.person_id = p.id
JOIN movies m ON m.id = r.person_id
----

[source,cypher,id=star_9_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN elementId(p) AS element_id,
       p.born AS born, p.name AS name,
       elementId(r) AS element_id1, r.role AS role,
       elementId(m) AS element_id2,
       m.title AS title, m.released AS released
----

Ordering without specifying a table alias does work as expected:

[source,sql,id=star_6b,name=unqualifiedAsteriskSingleTable,metaData=Person:born|name]
----
SELECT * FROM Person p ORDER BY name ASC
----

you will get this Cypher statement

[source,cypher,id=star_6b_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN elementId(p) AS element_id,
       p.born AS born, p.name AS name
ORDER BY p.name
----

A qualified alias can be used as well.
In case without meta-data it will return a map of properties of the node or relationship in question:

[source,sql,id=star_4,name=mapQualifiedAsteriskWithoutMetadata]
----
SELECT m.*, p.*
FROM Person p
JOIN Movie m ON m.id = p.acted_in
----

The corresponding columns must be downcast to a Map in JDBC:

[source,cypher,id=star_4_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[acted_in:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN m{.*} AS m, p{.*} AS p
----

If we add meta-data (here `born` and `name` to `Person`), the qualified star will project all those:

[source,sql,id=star_4a,name=mapQualifiedAsteriskWithMetadata,metaData=Person:born|name]
----
SELECT p.*, m.title AS title
FROM Person p
JOIN Movie m ON m.id = p.acted_in
----

Note how we also projected one single, known property from the `Movie` node:

[source,cypher,id=star_4a_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[acted_in:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN elementId(p) AS element_id, p.born AS born, p.name AS name, m.title AS title
----

=== Returning nodes and relationships

A statement that projects a table alias such as

[source,sql,id=star_n,name=tableAlias]
----
SELECT m FROM Movie m
----

will result in a Cypher statement returning the matched node as node.

[source,cypher,id=star_n_expected]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m;
----

A node can be alias as well:

[source,sql,id=star_n2]
----
SELECT m AS node FROM Movie m
----

will result in a Cypher statement returning the matched node as node.

[source,cypher,id=star_n2_expected]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m AS node;
----

Unaliased tables can be used as well:

[source,sql,id=star_n3]
----
SELECT movie FROM Movie
----

[source,cypher,id=star_n3_expected]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie;
----

And multiple entities are supported, too:

[source,sql,id=star_10]
----
SELECT p, r, m FROM Person p
JOIN ACTED_IN r ON r.person_id = p.id
JOIN Movie m ON m.id = r.movie_id
----

[source,cypher,id=star_10_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) RETURN p, r, m
----

== Comparing SQL with Cypher examples

Sources of the following examples are from https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/guide-sql-to-cypher/[Comparing SQL with Cypher].

=== Find all Products

=== Select and Return Records

Easy in SQL, just select everything from the `products` table.

[source,sql,id=t2_0,name=select_and_return_records,table_mappings=products:Product]
----
SELECT p.*
FROM products as p
----

Similarly, in Cypher, you just *match* a simple pattern: all nodes with the *label* `:Product` and `RETURN` them.

[source,cypher,id=t2_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p{.*} AS p
----

The above query will project all properties of the matched node.
If you want to select the node itself, just select it without using the asterisk:

[source,sql,id=t2_0a,name=select_and_return_records,table_mappings=products:Product]
----
SELECT p
FROM products as p
----

It will be translated into a query that returns nodes:

[source,cypher,id=t2_0a_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p
----

=== Field Access, Ordering and Paging

*More efficient is to return only a subset of attributes*, like `ProductName` and `UnitPrice`.
And while we're on it, let's also order by price and only return the 10 most expensive items.

[source,sql,id=t2_1,name=field_acces_ordering_paging,table_mappings=products:Product]
----
SELECT p.`productName`, p.`unitPrice`
FROM products as p
ORDER BY p.`unitPrice` DESC
LIMIT 10
----

You can copy and paste the changes from SQL to Cypher, it's thankfully unsurprising.
But remember that labels, relationship-types and property-names are *case sensitive* in Neo4j.

[source,cypher,id=t2_1_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p.productName, p.unitPrice ORDER BY p.unitPrice DESC LIMIT 10
----

Default order direction will be translated as is:

[source,sql,id=t2_2,name=order_by_default]
----
SELECT * FROM Movies m ORDER BY m.title
----

[source,cypher,id=t2_2_expected,parseCypher=false]
----
MATCH (m:Movies)
RETURN * ORDER BY m.title
----

=== `DISTINCT` projections

The `DISTINCT` keyword for projections should be handled:

[source,sql,id=t3_1,name=distinct]
----
SELECT DISTINCT m.released FROM Movies m
----

[source,cypher,id=t3_1_expected,parseCypher=false]
----
MATCH (m:Movies)
RETURN DISTINCT m.released
----

It also works with `*` projections so that:

[source,sql,id=t3_2,name=distinct_star]
----
SELECT DISTINCT m.* FROM Movies m
----

becomes.

[source,cypher,id=t3_2_expected,parseCypher=true]
----
MATCH (m:Movies)
RETURN DISTINCT m {.*} AS m
----

However, as the qualified asterisks will use meta data if the database connection is available, this

[source,sql,id=t3_3,name=distinct_star_with_db,metaData=Movies:title|released]
----
SELECT DISTINCT m.* FROM Movies m
----

becomes than

[source,cypher,id=t3_3_expected,parseCypher=false]
----
MATCH (m:Movies)
RETURN DISTINCT elementId(m) AS element_id, m.title AS title, m.released AS released
----

including the Neo4j element id, which will make each row unique. Thus being sad, the `DISCTINCT` clause is of limited use with the asterisk.
