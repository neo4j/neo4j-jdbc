[#text2cypher]
= text2cypher

== Introduction

This is an experimental translator inspired by the Neo4j Labs project https://github.com/neo4j-labs/text2cypher[text2cypher].

If you add this translator to the classpath or use the <<text2cypher_bundle,text2cypher bundle>>, all queries that start with

[source,txt]
----
ðŸ¤–,
----

will be treated as _natural language_ queries written in plain english.
The driver will strip the prefix, and use https://openai.com[OpenAI] for translating the input into a Cypher statement.
The driver will augment the generation of the query by passing the current graphs schema along with the input question.

[WARNING]
====
Keep in mind that the following data will be sent to an external API:

* Your database schema, including label names
* Any natural language question that you or one of your user write

Don't use this translator if you don't want the above or are not a llowed to do so.
====

This module requires one additional configuration, the OpenAI API Key.
You can use either a URL parameter, JDBC Properties entry or a environment variable:

* URL parameter or properties name is: `openAIApiKey`
* Name of the environment variable is: `OPEN_AI_API_KEY`

One example of a valid URL is:

[source,txt]
----
jdbc:neo4j://localhost:7687?openAIApiKey=sk-xxx-your-key
----

With that in place, a query such as the following should work just fine:

[source,txt]
----
ðŸ¤–, How was The Da Vinci Code rated?
----

NOTE: Once a natural language query was translated to Cypher, the result will be cached and further invocations of that query will use the cached result.

All that statements that do not start with ðŸ¤– will be used as is and treated as Cypher.
