= SQL to Cypher translation

== Introduction

The translation of queries from SQL to Cypher is an optional feature of this driver and it consists of two parts:

- The translator SPI, located in the module `{group-id}:neo4j-jdbc-translator-spi`.
It consists of two interfaces: `SqlTranslatorFactory` and the actual `SqlTranslator`.
- A concrete implementation of this SPI, published as `{group-id}:neo4j-jdbc-translator-impl`.

The latter is covered in "xref:s2c[]" and available in the "full bundle", described in xref:distribution.adoc#available_bundles[Available bundles].
The former is provided for two reasons: it allows us to distribute the driver with and without the bundled, default translator and allows you to run your custom translator.

Translators can be chained, and there can be as many translators on the classpath as you want.
Their precedence is configurable, with our default implementation having the lowest precedence.
Thus, you can for example have a custom translator that takes care of a fixed set of queries and, if it receives a query it cannot translate, it will pass it down to our implementation.

Translating arbitrary SQL queries to Cypher is an opinionated task, as there is no right way to map table names to graph objects: a table name can be used as-is as a label, or may be transformed into a singular form, etc. Mapping relationships is even trickier: should relationship types derive from a join table, a join column (in that case, which one?), or a foreign key?

We believe our assumptions are appropriate for various use cases and instead of providing configuration to cater for all scenarios, we offer the possibility to write your own translation layer.
The driver will use the standard Java service loader mechanism to find an implementation of the SPI on the module- or classpath.

NOTE: Some tools (like Tableau) use a class-loader that won't let the driver use the standard Java service loader mechanism.
For these scenarios, we provide an additional configuration property named `translatorFactory`.
Set this to `DEFAULT` to directly load our default implementation or to a fully-qualified classname for any other factory.
*Be aware* that either our default implementation or your custom one must be on the classpath.

== Translating SQL to Cypher

There's only one requirement to enable the SQL-to-Cypher translation: you have to have one module implementing the SPI on the classpath.
This is *automatically* the case if you use the full-bundle (`{group-id}:{artifact-id-full-bundle}`).
In that case, you *don't* need to add any other dependency.
If you use the individual distribution or the "small" bundle `{group-id}:{artifact-id-bundle}`, you must add the artifact `{group-id}:{artifact-id-impl}`.

The implementation will be automatically loaded.
If you use the translation on a case-by-case basis, it will be lazily loaded (i.e no additional classes are touched or loaded into memory).
If you configure automatic translation for all statements, the implementation will be eagerly loaded.
There are no further configuration options with regard to loading the implementation.

=== On a case-by-case basis

The translator can be used on a case-by-case basis through the official JDBC API `nativeSQL`, which you find on the `java.sql.Connection` class.
With the following imports:

[source, java, tabsize=4]
----
include::{examplesDir}/SQLTranslator.java[tag=imports]
----

You just pass your SQL statement to `nativeSQL` and you will get Cypher back:

[source, java, tabsize=4, indent=0]
----
include::{examplesDir}/SQLTranslator.java[tag=pt1]
----

=== For all queries

If you open the connection to your Neo4j instance using `enableSQLTranslation=true` either as URL parameter or configuration property, all statements will be translated from SQL to Cypher.
If you configure the driver in this way, the translator will be eagerly loaded.

[source, java, tabsize=4, indent=0]
----
include::{examplesDir}/SQLTranslator.java[tag=pt2]
----

Sometimes you may need to fall back to Cypher for some statements, either to use constructs that you cannot express with SQL, or because our default translator cannot handle your query.
We offer a special comment that you can use as a hint in your statement to stop automatic translation: `/*+ NEO4J FORCE_CYPHER */`.

[source, java, tabsize=4, indent=0]
----
include::{examplesDir}/SQLTranslator.java[tag=force-cypher]
----

=== Possible error scenarios

A `NoSuchElementException` with a message of `No SQL translators available` will be thrown when there is no implementation of the SQL to Cypher translator available, and you either used `java.sql.Connection.nativeSQL` or enabled automatic translation. The exception will be thrown when you access the method or eagerly on opening a connection in the latter case.

[#s2c]
== Using the default translator

=== Supported SQL dialects

Our default translator uses the OSS parser from https://www.jooq.org[jOOQ], which supports a broad spectrum of SQL dialects already.
We picked the generic, default dialect of jOOQ as our default dialect, but you can overwrite this in the SQL to Cypher configuration using the parameter `s2c.sqlDialect` with one of the supported dialects listed in <<s2c_configuration, configuration below>>.
`POSTGRES` can be a good choice for several integrations.

Bear in mind though that any shortcomings in the translation are probably not due to a lack in the parser, but due to the lack of an obvious, semantically equivalent Cypher construct.
That means we might be able to parse a certain piece of SQL, but are unable to translate in into something meaningful that Neo4j can understand without additional, contextual information.


[#s2c_configuration]
=== Configuration

The default implementation provides a number of configuration settings.
They must be prefixed with `s2c` in the URL or config options:

|===
|Name |Meaning|Default

|`parseNameCase`
|Whether to parse table names as is or not.
|`true`

|`tableToLabelMappings`
|A map from table names to labels.
|An empty map

|`joinColumnsToTypeMappings`
|A map from column names to relationship types.
|An empty map

|`prettyPrint`
|Whether to format the generated Cypher or not.
|`true`

|`alwaysEscapeNames`
|Whether to always escape names.
|Unless explicitly configured `false` when pretty printing is on, otherwise `true`.

|`sqlDialect`
|Which dialect to use when parsing. Supported values are `POSTGRES`, `SQLITE`, `MYSQL`, `H2`, `HSQLDB`, `DERBY` and `DEFAULT`.
|`DEFAULT`
|===

The next few examples use the `properties` config to avoid terrible long URLs in this documentation, but all the attributes can be specified via URL as well.

[source, java, tabsize=4, indent=0]
.Disable pretty printing; only escape if necessary; configure dedicated table mappings
----
include::{examplesDir}/SQLTranslator.java[tag=config1]
----

[source, java, tabsize=4, indent=0]
.Parse table names into upper case
----
include::{examplesDir}/SQLTranslator.java[tag=config2]
----

Named parameter syntax in the SQL parser defaults to `:name` (such as supported by Oracle, JPA, Spring, a colon followed by a name).
The following example changes that prefix to `$` (the same prefix that Cypher uses):

[source, java, tabsize=4, indent=0]
.Change parameters prefix and add mappings for join columns
----
include::{examplesDir}/SQLTranslator.java[tag=config3]
----

This is helpful when a tool generates names like that and does not allow customization.
