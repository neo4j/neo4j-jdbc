 * The Neo4j duration is different from both Java's {@link java.time.Duration}
 * <strong>and</strong> {@link java.time.Period}. In Java, those are different concepts,
 * in which a duration is always time based and exact for the supported units while a
 * period is calendar based and therefore does not always have the same number of dates.
 * The Neo4j {@link IsoDuration} reassembles what Neo4j does, but blurs the lines between
 * a duration and a period.
