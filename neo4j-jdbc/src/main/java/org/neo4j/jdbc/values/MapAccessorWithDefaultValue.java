/**
 * Provides methods to access the value of an underlying unordered map by key. When
 * calling the methods, a user need to provide a default value, which will be given back
 * if no match found by the key provided. The default value also servers the purpose of
 * specifying the return type of the value found in map by key. If the type of the value
 * found A differs from the type of the default value B, a cast from A to B would happen
 * automatically. Note: Error might arise if the cast from A to B is not possible.
