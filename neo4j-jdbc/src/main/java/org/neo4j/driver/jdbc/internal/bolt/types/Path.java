/**
 * A <strong>Path</strong> is a directed sequence of relationships between two nodes. This
 * generally represents a <em>traversal</em> or <em>walk</em> through a graph and
 * maintains a direction separate from that of any relationships traversed.
 * <p>
 * It is allowed to be of size 0, meaning there are no relationships in it. In this case,
 * it contains only a single node which is both the start and the end of the path.
